0.6.1 (2017-08-28)
    * Fix bug causing su_state to always appear to be active.

0.6.0 (2017-08-25)
    * Don't cache the old or active user to guarantee that SuState.auth_user
      and SuState.active_user are always valid, even if ``request.user``
      or ``request.session["su_auth_user_id"]`` changes. This also lazy-loads
      SuState.old_user, which will improve performance for requests where it
      isn't used.
    * The internal API has been changed, hence the minor version bump. There
      is no change to the external API.

0.5.1 (2017-02-03)
    * Use AnonymousUser for SuState.auth_user instead of crashing if
      request.user is not set.
    * Fix Django 1.10 compatibility (thanks @mokutsu;
      https://github.com/wolever/django-switchuser/pull/6)

0.5.0 (2016-08-11)
    * Lazy load su_state so it can safely be listed first in
      MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES

0.4.1 (2016-05-03)
    * Allow custom user models and add Django 1.9 compatibility (thanks
      @garyayo; https://github.com/wolever/django-switchuser/pull/5)
